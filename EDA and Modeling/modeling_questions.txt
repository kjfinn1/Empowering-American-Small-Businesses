Maybe filter so that no NAs in funding_office_id or funding_office_name or agency versions of these variables? import_dataset()

Why do we need to remove NAs concerning IDV_CONTRACTING_AGENCY_ID?

Do we need IDV_PIID, PIID?

Do we need EVALUATED_PREFERENCE?

Do we need IDV_CONTRACTING_AGENCY_ID?

Should we just strip the whole dataframe of whitespace? [Yeah, why not]

What does the SAM dataset actually add to our modeling right now? What could it if we used it properly?

Can we use DOLLARS_OBLIGATED? I think no? We should assess model performance when filtering by >0 of it vs not.

Do we see heterogeneity in recommendations?

Get cosine similarities of office names as a way to clean the offices?

Maybe output the agency originally, and then output the office from that (nested model)

Could also look at it as an NLP/ETA problem b/c it's a sparse matrix and use PCA?
